Usage
1. Install the Add-on
Save the code as a .py file (e.g., view_layer_export.py).
Open Blender, go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons.
Click Install and select the .py file you saved.
Enable the add-on by checking the box next to Export View Layers.
2. Set Up the Scene and Export Settings
Set Up View Layers: Configure each view layer in your scene to contain the specific elements you want to render independently.
Export Properties:
Go to the Properties panel in Blender.
In the Scene properties tab, locate the View Layer Export Properties section (added by the add-on).
Set the desired output directory, start frame, end frame, and file format for the exported images.
3. Run the Export
Once your settings are configured, initiate the export by pressing F3 (or Spacebar in some Blender versions) to open the search menu.
Search for and select Export View Layers.
The add-on will start rendering each view layer as a PNG sequence according to the specified frame range and settings, saving the output files in the chosen directory.
